## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Distinguish between tidy and messy data structures, and use pivots (`pivot_wider()`, `pivot_longer()`) to transform between them.
- Calculate descriptive statistics (averages, maxima) and explore associations between variables using visualizations, explaining why tidy data makes these tasks more straightforward.
- Visualize relationships between financial variables (e.g., share price and EPS) and interpret the economic meaning of these patterns.
- Use mutating joins (`left_join()`, `inner_join()`, `anti_join()`) to combine data sets and understand the role of primary and foreign keys.
- Diagnose missing or underrepresented data with filtering joins, and assess their implications for business analysis.
- Produce comparative visualizations of industry P/E ratios over time, using colorblind-friendly palettes for clarity and accessibility.
